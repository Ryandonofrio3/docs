Raindrop is the monitoring platform for AI agents. Similar to how Sentry tracks errors in your web apps, Raindrop discovers silent agent failures in production.

AI agents fail differently than traditional software. A 500 error is obvious. An agent that confidently gives wrong information, forgets something the user said 3 messages ago, or takes a suboptimal path are failures invisible to traditional monitoring.
Raindrop helps you:
Detect issues automatically: default signals catch common failure modes like forgetting, user frustration, and task failures
Search across millions of interactions: Use Deep Search to find specific issues in your production data with natural language
Track custom signals: Define any signal you care about (eg. syntax errors, aesthetic complaints, agent stuck in a loop) and track it at scale
A/B test your agents: Run experiments to validate that your fixes actually worked
